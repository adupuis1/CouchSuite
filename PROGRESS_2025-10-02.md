# CouchSuite Progress — 2025-10-02

## Highlights
- Moved the desktop launcher implementation into `CouchLauncherDesktop/desktopApp/src/jvmMain/`, keeping the Raspberry Pi client lightweight while matching the documented controller → login → hub flow.
- Wired the launcher directly to CouchServer using Ktor-based API calls (login, register, catalog refresh, session start) so each device can pull its tenant-specific build on demand.
- Trimmed the shared module to a placeholder and removed the old `sharedDirectory/` staging area, keeping the repo focused on the server + desktop deliverables we actually ship.
- Updated `desktopApp/build.gradle.kts` for desktop-only composition plus Ktor/coroutines/serialization dependencies, ready for packaging and future Pi provisioning.

## Direction
- Treat Raspberry Pi devices as thin HDMI consoles: controller detection gates entry, cached sessions resume quickly, and every Pi talks to CouchServer for per-user builds.
- CouchServer remains the multi-tenant control plane—continue scaling APIs, session orchestration, and ownership proofs to handle thousands of concurrent clients.
- Upcoming work centers on persistence (host/profile cache), hardware detection, deployment automation, and backend hardening for large fleet management.

## Next Steps
1. Persist launcher config (host, token, last user) locally on the Pi and reload it on boot.
2. Replace the controller toggle with real Linux gamepad/Bluetooth detection for Raspberry Pi hardware.
3. Script Pi provisioning: install launcher service, set host/org via env/CLI, auto-update binaries.
4. Add CouchServer-side throttles/metrics to safeguard “countless” concurrent `/sessions` requests.
5. Implement telemetry heartbeats from launchers to track fleet health and trigger upgrades.
